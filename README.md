# Student Union Election Management System

Welcome to the Student Union Election Management System! I worked on this full-stack web application during my college to streamline the student union election process.
Live website is [here](https://studentsunion.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Project Overview

This project is built using Django for the back-end, with a front end created using the Django templating engine, pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a comprehensive platform for managing student elections efficiently.

## Key Features

### For Students
- **Nomination Applications**: Students can apply for nominations across four distinct levels, each with specific qualification criteria.
- **Voting**: Students can cast their votes for nominees during designated voting periods.
- **Election Results**: Students can view election results after the conclusion of each voting period.
- **Complaint Submission**: Students can submit complaints for review by an administrator.

### For Administrators
- **Statistical Review**: Admins can review and print statistics on the number of nominees and votes received.
- **Data Management**: Admins can upload new student data as needed.
- **Election Scheduling**: Admins can set specific dates for nomination, voting, and result announcement periods.
- **Complaint Management**: Admins can review complaints submitted by students.


## Learning Experience
This project was a rewarding endeavor that provided me with invaluable experience in web development, project management, and user interface design. I hope it inspires others in similar projects.
